       <p>My name is Alex and I am 10 years old the reason I have made this website/business is because I want to be able to have experience. Since this is my first website/bussiness It isn't about money but really the expirence I will gain so in the future I will have expirences to help me make my own business. So I hope you are willing to allow me to walk your dog.</p>
